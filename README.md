## Design Iterations and Reflections

A cognitive walkthrough with think-aloud protocol was done with 3 participants, and the following refinements was done:

1. Emojis for every studbud features, to better discern between features, as the previous icon bear similar colors with each other.
2. Adding a checklist feature and removing pin feature from reading list for consistency with task list, for better learnability and memorability.
4. One-sized navigation menu (i.e., no minimising and expansion features), as it was unnoticed and deemed unnecessary.
